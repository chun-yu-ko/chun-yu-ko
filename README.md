# About K.O. - Data Science is My Way of Life
:fish: :tropical_fish: :whale: :blowfish: :dolphin:

I find the blending of work and hobby a challenge, as data is both my profession and my passion. This overlap often makes it difficult to maintain a work-life balance. Thankfully, my partner and friends are always there to remind me to stay active, especially when work starts to take a toll on my body fat. I sometimes wish I could emulate the carefree nature of my roommate's two cats, who effortlessly lounge by the doorstep.

As a Data Scientist and Analyst, I have been engaged in related work continuously since 2015, specializing in data-driven decision-making, visualization, study design, and advanced analytics. My expertise is in enhancing company and product development in growth, operational, and marketing functions by leveraging statistical and data science knowledge to support business strategies.

I am a strong advocate for improving data literacy and skills across both our team and the entire company. We are dedicated to developing research methodologies that are specifically tailored to our business field, and we consistently strive to broaden our knowledge. Our team has been focusing on basic statistics and research design since 2021, and we are now delving into causal inference methods.

My role as a data analyst revolves around the mission of "Eliminating the distance from data to users." To achieve this, I continually update my data science skills, applying them in various side projects and in my professional work. I am also pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and am involved in several stimulating projects. You can find more about my work on my Medium and GitHub profiles.

## :office_worker: The Job Market for Data Science and Analytics in Taipei, Taiwan

A project aimed at understanding the Taiwanese Data Science and Analytics (DSA) job market as comprehensively as possible. By continuously gathering job vacancy data (an effort that has been ongoing for a year), we hope to uncover various facets of this employment market. However, my exploration is still in its preliminary, somewhat random stage.

## :bookmark_tabs: Casual Conversations with a Product Manager

I have written a series of articles, mainly about the questions I heard while talking with product managers in the past. Please check the following Medium post.

- [Medium - Q&A with PM](https://medium.com/the-whispers-of-a-data-analyst/tagged/qa)

## :running: Learning Causal Discovery

I use [bnlearn](https://www.bnlearn.com/) and [abn](http://r-bayesian-networks.org/) in R frequently, and occasionally dabble with gcastle in python.

Causal discovery do holds a very mysterious allure for data scientists and data analysts.

After reading the article [A survey of Bayesian Network structure learning
](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-022-10351-w)
I decided to challenge myself and delve into these algorithms.

Before I knew it, a weekend disappeared just like Atlantis.

## :page_with_curl: Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania

I attempted to reproduce the 1993 article by David Card, the 2021 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, in order to re-examine my understanding of natural experiments.

## :money_with_wings: Tips dataset

During my Master's coursework, I stumbled upon an interesting dataset. I applied EDA and used structural discovery to assist in causal inference and hypothesis testing for observational research.

As an Apple Watch user for 3 years, the accumulated data serves as an excellent foundation for a longitudinal study.
